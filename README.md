# Scrabble Webapp
This is a webapp using ReactJS for the front end, Spring for the backend, and MongoDB as the persistant storage. Based off a project for a university course where we implemented "Worlds Fastest Scrabble Solver" algorithm. Very much a work in progress (not complete). Also my first time learning Docker. Does not work on mobile.
