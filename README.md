# Scrabble Webapp
This is a webapp using ReactJS for the front end, Spring for the backend, and MongoDB as the persistant storage. Based off a project for a university course where we implemented "Worlds Fastest Scrabble Solver" algorithm. Very much a work in progress and in need of a small rewrite from what I've learned so far.
